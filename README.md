## Process

### step 1-Before everything, we should do a proper data understanding. But, unfortunately, there is no comprehensive description of this data set. Therefore I did not get a perfect insight into the data set.

### Step 3-Data cleaning, including missing value recognization, duplicate value elimination, and null column elimination, ...
### Step 4-Writing queries to answer the questions
### Step 5-Performing QA 


## Results
Results are presented in starting_with_questions.md file.

## Challenges
